# 20 — Statuses, Enums, and Reference Data

This document defines all status values, enum-like constants, and reference data used throughout the system. These definitions are the single source of truth — all workflow documents (10–16) and entity definitions (18) must use these exact values.

---

## 1. Purchase Request Statuses

Used on `purchase_requests.status`. See `10-order-workflow.md` for transition rules.

| Value (DB) | Display Label | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `draft` | Draft | Order created but not finalized (future — not in MVP cart flow) |
| `in_cart` | In Cart | Items added to the user's cart; not yet submitted |
| `pending_approval` | Pending Approval | Order submitted; awaiting Focal Point review |
| `modified` | Modified | Focal Point has modified the order before approving |
| `approved` | Approved | Order approved; vendor email dispatch triggered |
| `email_sent` | Email Sent | Vendor notification email(s) dispatched |
| `pending_delivery` | Pending Delivery | Vendor notified; awaiting physical delivery |
| `partially_received` | Partially Received | Some (not all) line items have been checked in |
| `fully_received` | Fully Received | All line items fully received; order complete |
| `cancelled` | Cancelled | Order cancelled by requester, Focal Point, or Admin |

### Status Transitions

```
draft → in_cart → pending_approval → modified → approved → email_sent → pending_delivery → partially_received → fully_received
                  pending_approval → approved   (direct approve, no modification)
                  pending_approval → cancelled   (rejected or requester cancelled)
                  approved → email_sent          (auto-transition after emails sent)
                  email_sent → pending_delivery  (auto-transition after all emails succeed)
                  pending_delivery → partially_received → fully_received
                  approved/email_sent/pending_delivery → cancelled   (Admin only)
```

## 2. Purchase Request Line Item Statuses

Used on `purchase_request_items.status`. See `10-order-workflow.md`.

| Value (DB) | Display Label | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pending` | Pending | Line item submitted; not yet received |
| `partially_received` | Partially Received | Some quantity checked in, but not all |
| `fully_received` | Fully Received | All ordered quantity checked in |
| `removed` | Removed | Line item removed by Focal Point during modification |

---

## 3. Inventory Lot Statuses

Used on `inventory_lots.status`. See `11-checkin-workflow.md`.

| Value (DB) | Display Label | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `active` | Active | Lot is in inventory, available for checkout |
| `depleted` | Depleted | Lot quantity has reached zero through checkouts |
| `expired` | Expired | Lot has passed its expiry date |
| `quarantined` | Quarantined | Lot flagged due to high peroxide levels (> 100 ppm) or other safety concern |
| `disposed` | Disposed | Lot has been officially disposed of |

### Status Transitions

```
active → depleted        (quantity_remaining reaches 0 via checkout)
active → expired         (expiry_date passes; can be set by scheduled job or on-access check)
active → quarantined     (peroxide test > 100 ppm)
expired → active         (shelf-life extension: new expiry date set)
quarantined → disposed   (disposal action by Focal Point / Admin)
expired → disposed       (disposal action)
```

### Note on `expired` Detection

The system can detect expiry in two ways:
1. **On-access check:** When a lot is loaded for checkout or display, compare `expiry_date` to today. If expired and status is still `active`, update to `expired`.
2. **Scheduled job:** A nightly batch process updates all lots where `expiry_date < today AND status = 'active'` to `expired`.

Both approaches should be used for robustness.

For **textual results** (where PPM is not available), the classification is manually selected by the user.

| `textual` | Textual | Descriptive result (e.g., "Negative"); user selects classification manually |
| `visual_inspection` | Visual Inspection | Pass/fail visual inspection (used for Peroxide_TS type); user selects classification manually |

---

## 6. Peroxide Classification Groups

> **Note:** This replaces the earlier 3-class (A/B/C) system. See `07-category-behavior-matrix.md` for the sub-type reference table and `13-peroxide-workflow.md` for full monitoring and disposal rules per type.

## Reference Data Seeding Summary

The following reference tables must be seeded with initial data before the application can operate:

| Table | Seed Data | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `roles` | admin, focal_point, user | Fixed set of 3 roles; changes require application update |
| `item_categories` | CHEM, GAS, MAT, STD | Rarely changed; Admin can add more |
| `locations` | AIE, MTP, CT, ATC | Based on current org structure |
| `labs` | Per-location labs (from stakeholder input) | 17 labs total. See `03-locations-and-labs-structure.md` |
| `vendors` | Chemex, Hach, 3M, Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, Ametek Brookfield, Labscan, Loba, Labsupply, BIG, Linde, S&T, ThreeBond, TBS | From MaterialList and POnumber sheets |
| `regulations` | VoOrOrKo7, FACCHEM, Munition | From MaterialList Regulatory column |
| `po_number_mappings` | 25 pre-assigned PO number mappings | From POnumber sheet. See `10-order-workflow.md` |
| `users` | Initial admin account(s) | At least one admin user must be seeded with a bcrypt-hashed password so the system can be bootstrapped. Additional users are created via the admin UI. |

All other enum-like values (statuses, transaction types, source types, location scope types) are **application-defined constants** validated in the API layer, not separate database tables.
